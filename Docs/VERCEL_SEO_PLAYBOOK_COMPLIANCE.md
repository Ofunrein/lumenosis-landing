---

## 🟡 Partially Implemented (Could Be Improved)

### 1. **Internationalization (i18n)** 🟡 **Optional**
**Vercel Says:** "Prep your codebase to accept various languages and regions"

**Current Status:**
- ❌ No i18n configuration
- ❌ No hreflang tags
- ❌ Single language (English only)

**Should We Implement?**
- 🤔 Only if targeting international markets
- 🤔 Current focus is US real estate market
- 🤔 Can be added later if expanding globally

**Priority:** LOW (not needed for current market)

---

### 2. **Breadcrumbs UI** 🟡 **Nice to Have**
**Vercel Says:** "Breadcrumbs reinforce site structure"

**Current Status:**
- ✅ BreadcrumbList schema implemented (Google can see it)
- ❌ No visual breadcrumbs in UI

**Example of what we could add:**
```
Home > Solutions > AI Lead Response
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (schema is there, UI is optional)

---

### 3. **Internal Linking Strategy** 🟡 **Good, Could Be Better**
**Vercel Says:** "Link from blog posts to services, case studies to contact"

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Good: Navigation links throughout
- ✅ Good: CTA buttons linking to contact
- ✅ Good: Overview section links to all main sections
- 🟡 Could improve: More contextual links within content
- 🟡 Could improve: Related resources sections

**Priority:** MEDIUM (current linking is solid, could be enhanced)

---

## ❌ Not Applicable (Not Needed for Our Use Case)

### 1. **Localization** ❌ **Not Needed**
**Vercel Says:** "Humanly adapt content for specific regions"

**Why Not Needed:**
- Target market: US real estate professionals
- Single language (English)
- No plans for international expansion yet

---

### 2. **Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)** ❌ **Not Needed**
**Vercel Says:** "Gone are the days of creating separate AMP pages"

**Why Not Needed:**
- Next.js provides fast performance out of the box
- Our mobile site is already optimized
- AMP is no longer necessary with modern frameworks
