# Lumenosis AI Landing Page

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is the landing page for Lumenosis AI - we help real estate agents and home service businesses automate their workflows with AI. Think less manual work, more time for what actually matters.

## What's Inside

We built this site to showcase what's possible when you combine AI with practical business needs. Here's what you'll find:

- **Hero Section** - Gets right to the point about what we do
- **Service Cards** - The actual automations we offer (no fluff)
- **Live Demos** - See the AI in action with real examples
- **Lead Magnets** - Free workflow templates you can actually use
- **FAQ** - Answers to questions we get asked constantly
- **Contact Form** - Reach out if you want to chat

## The Tech Behind It

We went with Next.js 14 for this build because, honestly, it just works:

- **Next.js 14** - App Router for better routing and server components
- **React 18** - For the interactive bits
- **TypeScript** - Keeps us from breaking things
- **Tailwind CSS** - Fast styling without the CSS headaches
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations that don't feel overdone
- **Vercel Analytics** - To see what's actually working

## Running It Locally

Pretty straightforward:

```bash
# Install everything
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Then head to `http://localhost:3000` and you're good to go.
